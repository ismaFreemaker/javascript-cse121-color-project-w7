        <p id="explanation">When clicking the button, you'll see the background of the website changing. With the colors Red, Green and Blue 
            you can do any color you want depending of the values of each. The code below of the color name is made of 
            six numbers and letters. The first two letters or numbers are from the red color, the second two from the green 
            and the second three from the blue. We are going to focus in the "f" letters wich means FULL. So when any of 
            the three pair groups mentioned have "ff" the color component is in FULL. <b>TRY CLICKING UNTIL YOU HAVE A FULL COLOR COMPONENT!</b>
